# Architecture Principles

## Introduction
Architectural Principles are long-lasting and rarely changing statements and guidelines that govern the design, implementation and operation of an organisation as it sets about fulfilling its mission. They are derived from the specific needs and priorities of the stakeholders and provide a decision-making framework for the architecture that govern its construction. A list of architectural principles defined in this section are the ones to drive architectural decisions for any citizen facing e-service or service delivery supporting platform implementation in NICS. Architectural principles can cover approaches at various levels of “depth” – some of them relate to the design process/approach, some to deployment platforms to be targeted, some are technical principles that drive implementation of the solution in a certain way, i.e., using certain patterns.

These principles are derived primarily from the [GDS Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice) and [Digital Service Standards](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)

## Benefit of having Architecture Principles
Following the Architecture Principles will help maintain an IT landscape across NICS that:
- meets the current needs of departments and prepares the IT landscape for evolving to meet future needs.
- enables integrated services built with a citizen centred approach.
- is easier to share across NICS and the broader public sector.
- is easier to maintain.
- scales for future use.
- provides better value for money.

## Components of Architecture Principles
In addition to a name and definition statement, each principles should have associated rational and implications statements, both to promote understanding and acceptance of the principles themselves, and to support the use of the principles in explaining and justifying why specific decisions are made.

## 1. Primacy of principles
  These principles of information management apply to all organizations within the NICS enterprise.

## 2. Maximise Benefit to the Enterprise
  Information management decisions are made to provide maximum benefit to the NICS enterprise as a whole.  
[Read more about maximising the benefits to the enterprise](./architecture-principles/maximise-benefits-to-the-enterprise.md)

## 3. Define the need you're addressing and how you will measure success
  Understand the "why" behind your work and how you will know if you are being successful in your efforts to create value.

## 4. Feedback loops
  Feedback loops should be established as a priority to help gather factual data about how successful work efforts are in achieving the desired outcome.

## 5. No undifferentiated heavy lifting
  Our effort should be put where we really add value. That’s why we have a cloud first policy and focus on open source software and open standards.

## 6. Be open, use open source and open standards
  Publish your code and use open source software to improve transparency, flexibility and accountability.  Build technology that uses open standards to ensure your technology works and communicates with other technology, and can easily be upgraded and expanded.

## 7. Leverage public cloud capabilities (where appropriate)  
  Public cloud hosting should be assessed as default choice.

## 8. Reuse over buy over build
We have a bias to reuse existing assets over buying an asset.  We have a bias to buy over build something new ourselves.

## 9. Make things secure
Keep systems and data safe with the appropriate level of security.

## 10. Make privacy integral
Make sure citizens' and staffs' rights are protected by integrating privacy as an essential part of your system.

## 11. Maintain service catalogues
Know and make visible as appropriate what assets (data, applications, services, APIs, Queues, etc) are available and being managed.  
[Read more about maintaining service catalogues](./architecture-principles/maintain-service-catalogues.md)

## 12.  Expose APIs and message queues
All data stores must be exposed via APIs.  All applications must provide APIs and/or message queues as standard to maximise reuse and interoperability.  
[Read more about exposing APIs and message queues](./architecture-principles/expose-apis-and-message-queues.md)

## 13. Common vocabulary and data definitions
Data is defined consistently throughout the enterprise, and the definitions are understandable and available to all users.  
[Read more about common vocabulary and data definitions](./architecture-principles/common-vocabulary-and-data-definitions.md)

## 14. Manage technical debt and obsolescence
Unaddressed technical debt increases the complexity and costs of maintaining ICT making it harder to upgrade software, transition services and deliver solutions that meet users’ needs.  
[Read more about managing technical debt and obsolescence](./architecture-principles/manage-technical-debt-and-obsolescence.md)

## 15. Design for automation
Automation of processes is a key enabler for doing more with less and a requirement for effective agile methodologies.  
[Read more about designing for automation](./architecture-principles/design-for-automation.md)

## 16. Enterprise Architecture Applies to External IT Providers
Outsourced activities must not be exceptions to the enterprise architecture simply because they are provided by a third party.

As outsourcing contracts and agreements are entered into, they must reflect and incorporate all NICS architecture principles, including Intellectual Property Rights.

## 17. Protection of Intellectual Property
The protection of the enterprise's Intellectual Property must be reflected in the IT architecture, implementation, and governance processes.

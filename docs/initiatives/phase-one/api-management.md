# API Management

## Mission

The core objectives of this mission are to:

1. Provide developers with the tools to publish and manage APIs, their versions and revisions
2. Provide a portal to expose available APIs and manage subscriptions
3. Provide guidance for developers on what APIs should look like and how they should be secured

## What problem are we solving

There is very limited reuse of application components outside of any specific application. APIs are not widely used to provide integration between
applications and therefore there is little visibility of them. This dramatically reduces the possibility of re-use at a service level and potentially
leads to duplication at a code level.

# No undifferentiated heavy lifting

## Statement
Our effort should be put where we really add value. That’s why we have a cloud first policy and focus on source software and open standards.

## Rational
All assets can be placed somewhere on a scale ranging from highly specialised, niche assets at one end of the scale, through to utility/commodity assets.    Over time as systems and industries mature, assets tend to move towards becoming utility or commodity assets.  We should leverage commodity assets to free up our capacity to focus on specific work to meet the IT needs of the NICS.

## Implications
- [Be open, use open source and open standards](./be-open-use-open-source-and-open-standards.md)
- [Leverage public cloud capabilities](./leverage-public-cloud-capabilities.md) where appropriate
- [Reuse over buy over build](./reuse-over-buy-over-build.md)

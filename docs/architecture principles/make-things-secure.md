# Make things secure

## Statement
Keep systems and data safe with the appropriate level of security.

## Rational
Include security at the start of the project. Have your team involved in making each element secure instead of your security experts adding technical countermeasures to a finished product.

Training users and having clear processes are important for security, as is doing realistic threat assessments and taking a balanced approach to managing risk.

Plan how to deny, and quickly recover from, malicious access. Make sure you have processes in place to record information about any attacks and use this data to improve defences.

## Implications
- Choose the appropriate level of security for your technology project or programme.
- Consider the risks and have processes in place to mitigate against them and improve time to recovery.
- Refer to and implement the advice GDS Guidance on [how to secure your technology](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-things-secure#how-to-secure-your-technology)

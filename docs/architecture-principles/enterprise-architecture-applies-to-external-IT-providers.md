# Enterprise Architecture applies to external IT providers

## Statement
Outsourced activities must not be exceptions to the enterprise architecture simply because they are provided by a third party.

As outsourcing contracts and agreements are entered into, they must reflect and incorporate all NICS architecture principles.

## Rational
To be successful, enterprise architecture must be integrated with all information system projects and operational change activities.

## Implications
- Work needs to be done to inform procurement areas on enterprise architecture issues and develop practices that ensure these considerations are addressed.
- This requires partnerships and efficient communication between the departments, procurement and information technology areas to get the benefits offered	by the enterprise architecture.
- Information technology acquisitions must include requirements based on the enterprise architecture.

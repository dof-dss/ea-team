# Leverage public cloud capabilities (where appropriate)

## Statement
Public cloud hosting should be assessed as default choice.

## Rational
To modernize approach of building and hosting government solutions, gain benefits of on-demand infrastructure provisioning and scalability, ready-made platform as a service component, public cloud hosting should be assessed as default choice.  

## Implications
- When architecting and designing solutions to support citizen services delivery, public cloud technologies and hosting approach should be considered as default.  
- This also means that hybrid solutions leveraging new public cloud capabilities while accessing existing private cloud and onpremises systems/services should be default end-to-end model for the service implementation.

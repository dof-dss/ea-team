# Feedback Loops

## Statement
Feedback loops should be established as a priority to help gather factual data about how successful work efforts are in achieving the desired outcome.

## Rational
Being data informed helps us to make better decisions and this means seeking ways to get relevant feedback on our work at all stages of the lifecycle, including during development efforts.  Doing so will help to eliminate wasted effort and minimise the risk of failure when work is deployed to live users.

## Implications
- Prior effort has been made to identify who the users will be and their need that is being addressed by the work effort.
- Actual users must be engaged to gain feedback and so must be partnered with during the development effort.
- Feedback allows you to be data-informed.  It should be used to improve future decision-making.

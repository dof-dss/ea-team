# Common vocabulary and data definitions

## Statement
Data is defined consistently throughout the enterprise, and the definitions are understandable and available to all users.

## Rational
The data that will be used in the development of applications must have a common definition throughout the enterprise to enable sharing of data. A common vocabulary will facilitate communications and enable dialog to be effective. In addition, it is required to interface systems and exchange data.

## Implications
- Significant additional energy and resources must be committed to this task. It is key to the success of efforts to improve the information environment. This is separate from but related to the issue of data element definition, which is addressed by a broad community - this is more like a common vocabulary and definition.
- The enterprise must establish the initial common vocabulary; the definitions will be used uniformly throughout the enterprise.
- Whenever a new data definition is required, the definition effort will be co-ordinated and reconciled with the corporate "glossary" of data descriptions.
- Ambiguities resulting from multiple parochial definitions of data must give way to accepted enterprise-wide definitions and understanding.
- Functional data administration responsibilities must be assigned.

# Reuse over buy over build

## Statement
Avoid duplicating effort and unnecessary costs by collaborating across government and sharing and reusing technology, data, and services.

## Rational
Reuse of existing assets maximises our return on investment, limits the proliferation of assets in the IT landscape - thus reducing maintenance costs - and accelerates the delivery of work at little or no extra cost.  Where no existing asset is deemed suitable we prefer to buy, particularly for utility/commodity assets.  This frees up our developer capacity to focus on delivering value to citizens.  

By sharing your work you can benefit from:
- easier collaboration with other organisations.
- a larger pool of experts who can help you find solutions to any issues more quickly.
- more integration between government technologies.

By reusing existing technology you can benefit from:
- avoiding duplication and unnecessary spending.
- speeding up initial project or programme phases.
- better value for money.

## Implications
- [Service catalogues must be maintained](./maintain-service-catalogues.md) to ensure widespread awareness of the existing assets, their health and lifecycle status.
- Assets are shared across departments to [maximise the benefits to the enterprise](./maximise-benefits-to-the-enterprise.md).

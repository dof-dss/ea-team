# Define the need you're addressing and how you will measure success

## Statement
Understand the "why" behind your work and how you will know if you are being successful in your efforts to create value.

## Rational
There should be good cause for introducing anything into the NICS IT landscape.  There must be a well understood reason - a specific user need or problem being addressed, or an opportunity being expolited - for introducing the asset.  It follows therefore that everything must be adding value to someone, and the outcome of introducing the asset - some change in user behaviour must be measureable.  It is imperative that a metric that truly  measures the asset's reason for existing be identified and a mechanism for gathering the metric be implemented.

## Implications
- There must be a tangible reason *why* work is being undertaken and *who* will benefit from it, i.e. the desired outcome the work is intended to achieve.
- Develop knowledge of your target audience (*who*) and what that means for your work.
- One "metric that matters" / Key Performance Indicator (KPI) should be identified that truly reflects whether the desired outcome is being achieved or not.
- The KPI must be actionable and give some context, i.e. a ratio or percentage.  For example a KPI reporting "300 transactions completed online last month" doesn't have the context to understand if 300 was good or not.  Is it 300 out of 500 transactions last month, or 300 out of 5000 transactions last month?  A KPI reporting 60% (or 6%) gives meaning and context that can be used to better inform decision-making around next steps.
- Steps must be taken to collect necessary data to report on the KPI as part of the first deliverable, in order to create a [feedback loop](./feedback-loops.md).
- A hypothesis based approach, where assumptions are derisked to build confidence should be adopted.  A suggested format is as follows:
```
We believe <introducing a shiny new asset>
Will <bring about a positive change *why*>
For <users *who*>.
We will know this is true when <we achieve target% change in users' behaviour *KPI*>
```
The hypothesis should then be tested to determine if the assumed 'cause and effect' relationship actually exists and if that correlation is sufficiently strong, i.e. a threshold for determining if the hypothesis is valid or not is declared up front.  For example

```
We believe caching database calls
Will make our web page appear faster and more responsive
For citizens applying for their AccessNI check.
We will know this is true when we see page load times improve by 20%
```

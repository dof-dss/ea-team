# Maintain service catalogues

## Statement
Know and make visible as appropriate what assets (data, applications, services, APIs, Queues, etc) are available and being managed.  

## Rational
It is important to provide unified structured service catalogues, regardless of the department providing the actual service, so that citizens or business representatives get a unified experience of finding and launching the services they want to consume from government.

Similarly, it is important to provide internal unified structured service catalogues, regardless of the department providing the actual service, so that developers get a unified experience of finding, onboarding onto and consuming shared assets as a means of accelerating development.
 
## Implications
- Leverage common service catalogue management whenever there are new services or changes to services delivered to citizens or business representatives 
- Leverage common service catalogue management of internal assets for consumption by developers.

# Manage technical debt and obsolescence

## Statement
Unaddressed technical debt increases the complexity and costs of maintaining ICT making it harder to upgrade software, transition services and deliver solutions that meet usersâ€™ needs.

## Rational
Applications naturally grow stale over time as technology moves on (e.g. patches and upgrades to operating systems, frameworks or languages).  Without deliberate, planned effort to maintain applications the technical debt increasingly inhibits our ability to support users' needs.

The Future ICT for the company must make changes easier. Any tactical decisions that introduce technical debt (quick but messy solutions) will only be endorsed if there is a recognised actionable plan to address those decisions both technically and financially.

## Implications
- Application support and maintenance must be prioritised along with new development work.
- Applications maintenance may be driven by decisions that deem a technology to be no longer supported within the enterprise.
- Failure to maintain applications must be recognised as a risk to that application and all systems that depend on/consume the application.

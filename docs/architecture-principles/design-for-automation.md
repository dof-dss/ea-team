# Design for automation

## Statement
Automation of processes is a key enabler for doing more with less and a requirement for effective agile methodologies.  

## Rational
Automation of processes increases productivity and improves consistency and quality by reducing the chance of human error.  A DevSecOps approach applies the  principle of [no undifferentiated heavy lifting](./no-undifferentiated-heavy-lifting.md) to the software development activitie, particularly around build and test activities.  

## Implications
- Common tasks such as machine set up should be automated.
- CI/CD should be adopted

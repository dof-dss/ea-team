# Protection of Intellectual Property

## Statement
The protection of the enterprise's Intellectual Property must be reflected in the IT architecture, implementation, and governance processes.  

## Rational
A major part of NICS's IP is hosted in the IT domain.

## Implications
- While protection of IP assets is everybody's business, much of the actual protection is implemented in the IT domain. Even trust in non-IT processes can be managed by IT processes (email, mandatory notes, etc.).
- A security policy, governing human and IT actors, will be required that can substantially improve protection of IP. This must be capable of both avoiding compromises and reducing liabilities.

# Maximise Benefit to the Enterprise

## Statement
Information management decisions are made to provide maximum benefit to the NICS enterprise as a whole

## Rational
This principle embodies "service above self". Decisions made from an enterprise-wide perspective have greater long-term value than decisions made from any particular organizational perspective. Maximum return on investment requires information management decisions to adhere to enterprise-wide drivers and priorities. No minority group will detract from the benefit of the whole. However, this principle will not preclude any minority group from getting its job done.

## Implications
- Achieving maximum enterprise-wide benefit will require changes in the way we plan and manage information - technology alone will not bring about this change
- Some organizations may have to concede their own preferences for the greater benefit of the entire enterprise
- Application development priorities must be established by the entire enterprise for the entire enterprise
- Applications components should be shared across organizational boundaries
- Information management initiatives should be conducted in accordance with the enterprise plan
- Individual organizations should pursue information management initiatives which conform to the blueprints and priorities established by the enterprise. 

The plan will be changed as needed.

- As needs arise, priorities must be adjusted; a forum with comprehensive enterprise representation should make these decisions.

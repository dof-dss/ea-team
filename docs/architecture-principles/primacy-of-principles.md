# Primacy of Principles

## Statement
These principles of information management apply to all organizations within the NICS enterprise.

## Rational
The only way the NICS will be able to provide a consistent and measurable level of appropriately robust, reliable, sustainable services and quality information to decision-makers, is if all stakeholders abide by the NICS's principles.

## Implications
- Without this principle, exclusions, favoritism, and inconsistency would rapidly undermine the management of information.
- Information management initiatives will not begin until they are examined for compliance with the principles.
- A conflict with a principle will be resolved by changing the framework of the initiative.

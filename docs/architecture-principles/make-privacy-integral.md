# Make privacy integral

## Statement
Make sure citizens' and staffs' rights are protected by integrating privacy as an essential part of your system.


## Rational
Citizens and staff must be able to trust services provided by the government and NICS.  Ensuring privacy by design will 
- encourage us to be proactive about privacy and reduce the risks of data theft.
- identify potential privacy issues earlier when they are easier and cheaper to solve.
- ensure compliance with GDPR and other relevant legislation.

## Implications
- Refer to and follow [GDS Make privacy integral](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-privacy-integral) when designing solutions.
